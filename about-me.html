            <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
            <p><strong> I used to be a pack rat </strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved,
                 but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
                 <p>
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that 
                    I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. </p>
                <h3>How I turned things around </h3>
                <p> <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown </strong> when I got rid of everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, 
                    sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                <p> It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, 
                    I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

                <h3> Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed,
                     enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. </p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong> felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>
                    , and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
                     which is why I started this site!</p>
